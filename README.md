## Technical Details

This extension works by:
1. Extracting content from the current page (transcripts from YouTube videos if available, main text content from webpages)
2. Combining the content with your custom prompt and chosen AI model settings
3. Opening the selected AI model's website in a new tab
4. Automatically inserting the combined prompt into the AI model's input area

## Limitations

- YouTube transcript extraction relies on the availability of captions (auto-generated or official). If no captions are found, extraction will fail.
- Content extraction may not work perfectly on all website structures.

## Privacy

The extension itself does not collect any data. All content is processed locally, then sent directly to the chosen models in your browser.
